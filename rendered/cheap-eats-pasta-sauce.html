  <h1>Cheap Eats- Tomato Sauce!</h1>
  <p>
    When I'm not embarking on various food adventures with my <a
    href="http://twoguysonekitchen.com/" title="Two Guys, One Kitchen">
    culinary partners in crime</a>, I'm a fairly frugal at-home
    cook. One of my favorite things to make is my own tomato sauce. It's easy
    to make a bunch at once, it's turbo-versatile, and it freezes well.
  </p>

  <p>My recipe for tomato sauce:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 large (28oz) can of crushed or whole tomatoes in juice/puree</li>
    <li>1 carrot carrot, diced</li>
    <li>1 stalk of celery, diced</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>garlic (as much or as little as you fancy), chopped finely</li>
    <li>spices (parsley oregano, basil) to taste</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In a large dutch oven or saucepan, heat up about a quarter cup of olive
    oil (eyeballed, like most of the things in this recipe). Cook the celery
    and carrot together with a pinch of salt over medium-low heat for about 5
    minutes. Then add the onion, and cook for another 5-10 minutes, or until
    everything is soft, and the onions are translucent. Push the vegetation
    to the edges of the pan, and add a little more oil to the center. In
    that, cook the garlic for another few minutes, until it's <em>just</em>
    starting to take color. Then add the tomatoes and spices, stir, and bring
    everything up to a simmer. Cover the pan, and simmer for at
    <strong>least</strong> 45 minutes- but it will only get better from
    there.
  </p>

  <p>What to do with it?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Poach eggs</strong> in about a cup of sauce in a small
      saucepan. Serve with crusty bread or toast.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use it as the base for a <strong>quick chili</strong>- Take a can of
      black or kidney beans, 1/4 to 1/2 cup sauce, lots of cumin and chili
      powder,
      some hot sauce, and bring it all to a simmer. Then, I crush (or
      stick-blend) some of the beans to thicken slightly, and cook for
      another 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Spanish Rice</strong>- prepare rice, substituting half the
      liquid with sauce. Add diced peppers and cumin. Cook normally, being
      sure to stir often.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>What <em>else</em> can you do with it?</p>

  <p>Put it on pasta, dummy!</p>
