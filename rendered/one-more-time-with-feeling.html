  <p>I'm Back!
  <p>Maybe.
  <p>Probably.
  <p>
    Honestly, "back" implies that I ever really
    took a crack at this blogging thing with any seriousness at all before,
    which is dubious. But I am going to, yet again, try to make a serious
    effort at writing here regularly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="http://potch.me/">ol' ball and chain</a>'s been pretty
    busted the past few days. Why? As with anyone who wants to get back into
    the habit of writing, you must first re-build your blogging system from
    the ground-up. Obviously. <a
    href="http://github.com/potch/potch.me/">This time</a>, of course, will
    be different. Armed
    with my current favorite crop of technologies (which I will detail
    below), I'm writing a set of tools let me build static pages (or, in my
    far-too-literal to HTML5 system, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s) in my
    preferred authoring environment: my beloved <a href="http://macromates.com/">code editor</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>(I start nerding out right about here.)</h2>
  <p>
    I've been writing HTML long enough that it's caused permanent brain
    damage. I think of all documents in terms of markup, and deconstruct
    magazines to
    figure out how I'd float that sidebar <i>just</i> so. Naturally, then, I'm
    authoring posts directly in HTML. If I'd like a post to look a little
    different from the others, I have the ability to apply custom CSS and
    JavaScript. Anything too far afield, I can generate a one-off page that
    doesn't have to fit into the normal post template.
  </p>
  <p>
    To aid me in this process, I've called in support from some technologies
    I've fallen in love with in the line of duty working on my <a
    href="http://github.com/mozilla/zamboni/">current project</a> at Mozilla:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Python</b>: While I'd love to do this whole project in node.js, The
      package and file-interaction capabilities are just better in Python
      right now. I may migrate later, but getting up to speed quickly was my
      initial goal, and Python's got my back.
    <li>
      <b>Jinja</b>: We replace Django's templating engine in our projects at
      Mozilla with <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a>. The "block"
      pattern and template inheritance change the way you build markup
      template to more closely match the object oriented way you (hopefully)
      program. Fantastic stuff.
    <li>
      <b>PyQuery</b>: jQuery-style DOM manipulation in Python. Yes please.
    <li>
      <b>LESS</b>: Once you try <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> or <a
      href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, you'll wonder how you ever wrote
      or maintained CSS before.
  </ul>
  <p>
    I've got the code to the point where I decided to write this post, including a local server that watches files for changes. I'll be adding features and such (and writing about them here!), but this is my "Hello World".
  </p>
  <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
  <p>There's plenty more where that came from!</p>
  <p>I hope.</p>
