    <article><h1><s>Click and Drag</s> Press and Hold</h1>

    <p>I really loved <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/1110/">today's xkcd, "Click and Drag"</a>,
    but couldn't bring myself to spend that much time on my tiny trackpad,
    well, clicking and dragging. Never one to demur to the challenge of
    allowing myself future laziness, I wrote the following code to let me move
    around the incredible illustrated world with my keyboard. Faking mouse
    events FTW!</p>

    <p>Just copy and paste the code into your browser's JavaScript console to
    play!</p>

    <p>Here's the below code as a bookmarklet: <code><a href="javascript:function%20fakeMouseEvent(e,t,n)%7Bvar%20r=document.createEvent(%22MouseEvents%22);r.initMouseEvent(e,!0,!0,window,0,0,0,t,n,!1,!1,!1,!1,0,null),el.dispatchEvent(r)%7Dvar%20el=%24(%22.map%22)%5B0%5D,move=200;%24(window).keydown(function(e)%7Bvar%20t=e.which;if(t&gt;=37&amp;&amp;t&lt;=40)%7Be.preventDefault();var%20n=0,r=0;t==37&amp;&amp;(n+=move),t==38&amp;&amp;(r+=move),t==39&amp;&amp;(n-=move),t==40&amp;&amp;(r-=move),fakeMouseEvent(%22mousedown%22,0,0),setTimeout(function()%7BfakeMouseEvent(%22mousemove%22,n,r),setTimeout(function()%7BfakeMouseEvent(%22mouseup%22,n,r)%7D,0)%7D,0)%7D%7D);undefined;">Press and Hold</a></code></p>

    <pre><code>
// get the map element
var el = $('.map')[0];

// amount in pixels we want to move each keypress/hold
var move = 200;

function fakeMouseEvent(type, x, y) {
    var evt = document.createEvent("MouseEvents");
    evt.initMouseEvent(type, true, true, window,
                       0, 0, 0, x, y, false, false, false, false, 0, null);
    el.dispatchEvent(evt);
}

$(window).keydown(function(e) {
    var key = e.which;
    if (key &gt;= 37 &amp;&amp; key &lt;= 40) {
        e.preventDefault();
        var left=0, top=0;
        if (key == 37) { left += move; }
        if (key == 38) { top += move; }
        if (key == 39) { left -= move; }
        if (key == 40) { top -= move; }
        fakeMouseEvent('mousedown', 0, 0);
        setTimeout(function() {
            fakeMouseEvent('mousemove', left, top);
            setTimeout(function() {
                fakeMouseEvent('mouseup', left, top);
            }, 0);
        }, 0);
    }
});
    </code></pre>

    <article><h1>How I develop Firefox OS apps on Desktop</h1>

    <p>I've been working on the Marketplace for Mozilla's upcoming <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/b2g/">Firefox OS</a> mobile phone platform, which involves testing how web applications look and feel in the context of the OS. I can simulate the size of the phone in my browser using Firefox's amazing <a href="http://paulrouget.com/e/devtoolsupdate/">Responsive Mode</a>, but testing whether installing apps works and how the marketplace feels in-context involved putting my local development repository into <b>Gaia</b>, the phone's UI. I've been asked how to accomplish this feat numerous times, and it's easy enough to do that I thought I'd share it here!</p>

    <h2>Running Gaia on B2G</h2>

    <p>Firefox OS has two components- the underlying platform layer (called Boot To Gecko), and the user interface (called Gaia). I did the following to get these working together on my machine:</p>

    <p>Start by downloading a Desktop build of B2G. Mozilla generates these nightly in the same way we generate builds of Firefox. They're located on our FTP server:</p>

    <ul><li><a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/b2g-18.0a1.en-US.mac64.dmg">Mac</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/b2g-18.0a1.en-US.win32.zip">Windows</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/b2g-18.0a1.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2">Linux</a></li>
    </ul><p>Check out a copy of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia">Gaia</a>:</p>

    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia.git</code></pre>

    <p><code>cd</code> into your gaia repo.</p>

    <pre><code>make profile</code></pre>

    <p>This will generate a <code>profile</code> directory in your gaia repo.</p>

    <p>Start B2G using the generated profile as your profile. The B2G binary looks a lot like a Firefox binary; that's no coincidence! You can use the command line to specify a startup profile just as you would Firefox.</p>

    <pre><code>b2g --profile &lt;path to gaia profile&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>On my machine, the command looks like this:</p>

    <pre><code>/Applications/B2G.app/Contents/MacOS/b2g --profile /Users/potch/gaia/profile</code></pre>

    <p>If things are configured properly, B2G should start up using Gaia! This is all well and good, but I want to check out the app I'm working on in Gaia â€” Not too tricky!</p>

    <h2>Running your app on Gaia</h2>

    <p>If I'm building a packaged app, I just need to symlink or copy the directory of my app to the <code>apps</code> directory of Gaia. If I'm building a hosted app, It's only a little trickier to add your app in. To add your apps, create a directory in the `external-apps` folder containing 2 files:</p>

    <ul><li><code>origin</code>: this should contain the origin of your app (eg: <code>http://localhost</code> if you're developing locally)</li>
    <li><code>manifest.webapp</code> This is exactly what it sounds like- it's the manifest of your webapp.</li>
    </ul><p>Once you've put your app in gaia, re-run <code>make profile</code> to re-generate the profile, and re-launch B2G. Your app should now appear on the homescreen! If your app is packaged, you'll need to re-build your profile to see changes you make to your app. If your app is hosted, you'll only need to re-build if you change your origin or manifest.</p>

    <p>
        Happy Hacking!

    <article><h1>One More Time, With Feeling</h1>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rachaelvoorhees/1324652977/in/photostream/">
      <img src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1096/1324652977_28c2bab290.jpg"></a>
  </p>
  <p>I'm Back!
  </p><p>Maybe.
  </p><p>Probably.
  </p><p>
    Honestly, "back" implies that I ever really
    took a crack at this blogging thing with any seriousness at all before,
    which is dubious. But I am going to, yet again, try to make a serious
    effort at writing here regularly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="http://potch.me/">ol' ball and chain</a>'s been pretty
    busted the past few days. Why? As with anyone who wants to get back into
    the habit of writing, you must first re-build your blogging system from
    the ground-up. Obviously. <a href="http://github.com/potch/potch.me/">This time</a>, of course, will
    be different. Armed
    with my current favorite crop of technologies (which I will detail
    below), I'm writing a set of tools let me build static pages (or, in my
    far-too-literal to HTML5 system, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s) in my
    preferred authoring environment: my beloved <a href="http://macromates.com/">code editor</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>(I start nerding out right about here.)</h2>
  <p>
    I've been writing HTML long enough that it's caused permanent brain
    damage. I think of all documents in terms of markup, and deconstruct
    magazines to
    figure out how I'd float that sidebar <i>just</i> so. Naturally, then, I'm
    authoring posts directly in HTML. If I'd like a post to look a little
    different from the others, I have the ability to apply custom CSS and
    JavaScript. Anything too far afield, I can generate a one-off page that
    doesn't have to fit into the normal post template.
  </p>
  <p>
    To aid me in this process, I've called in support from some technologies
    I've fallen in love with in the line of duty working on my <a href="http://github.com/mozilla/zamboni/">current project</a> at Mozilla:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
      <b>Python</b>: While I'd love to do this whole project in node.js, The
      package and file-interaction capabilities are just better in Python
      right now. I may migrate later, but getting up to speed quickly was my
      initial goal, and Python's got my back.
    </li><li>
      <b>Jinja</b>: We replace Django's templating engine in our projects at
      Mozilla with <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a>. The "block"
      pattern and template inheritance change the way you build markup
      template to more closely match the object oriented way you (hopefully)
      program. Fantastic stuff.
    </li><li>
      <b>PyQuery</b>: jQuery-style DOM manipulation in Python. Yes please.
    </li><li>
      <b>LESS</b>: Once you try <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> or <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, you'll wonder how you ever wrote
      or maintained CSS before.
  </li></ul><p>
    I've got the code to the point where I decided to write this post, including a local server that watches files for changes. I'll be adding features and such (and writing about them here!), but this is my "Hello World".
  </p>
  <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
  <p>There's plenty more where that came from!</p>
  <p>I hope.</p>

  <h1>Cheap Eats- Tomato Sauce!</h1>
  <p>
    When I'm not embarking on various food adventures with my <a href="http://twoguysonekitchen.com/" title="Two Guys, One Kitchen">
    culinary partners in crime</a>, I'm a fairly frugal at-home
    cook. One of my favorite things to make is my own tomato sauce. It's easy
    to make a bunch at once, it's turbo-versatile, and it freezes well.
  </p>

  <p>My recipe for tomato sauce:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 large (28oz) can of crushed or whole tomatoes in juice/puree</li>
    <li>1 carrot carrot, diced</li>
    <li>1 stalk of celery, diced</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>garlic (as much or as little as you fancy), chopped finely</li>
    <li>spices (parsley oregano, basil) to taste</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In a large dutch oven or saucepan, heat up about a quarter cup of olive
    oil (eyeballed, like most of the things in this recipe). Cook the celery
    and carrot together with a pinch of salt over medium-low heat for about 5
    minutes. Then add the onion, and cook for another 5-10 minutes, or until
    everything is soft, and the onions are translucent. Push the vegetation
    to the edges of the pan, and add a little more oil to the center. In
    that, cook the garlic for another few minutes, until it's <em>just</em>
    starting to take color. Then add the tomatoes and spices, stir, and bring
    everything up to a simmer. Cover the pan, and simmer for at
    <strong>least</strong> 45 minutes- but it will only get better from
    there.
  </p>

  <p>What to do with it?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Poach eggs</strong> in about a cup of sauce in a small
      saucepan. Serve with crusty bread or toast.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use it as the base for a <strong>quick chili</strong>- Take a can of
      black or kidney beans, 1/4 to 1/2 cup sauce, lots of cumin and chili
      powder,
      some hot sauce, and bring it all to a simmer. Then, I crush (or
      stick-blend) some of the beans to thicken slightly, and cook for
      another 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Spanish Rice</strong>- prepare rice, substituting half the
      liquid with sauce. Add diced peppers and cumin. Cook normally, being
      sure to stir often.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>What <em>else</em> can you do with it?</p>

  <p>Put it on pasta, dummy!</p>
